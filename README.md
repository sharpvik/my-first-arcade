# Frogger game by Victor Rozenko and Udacity

This is a simple arcade game created as a final project for the Front End Web Developer Nanodegree by Udacity. Enjoy!

## How to seput 

This is a web application, therefore, *you don't need anything* to set it up.  
Just download the folder, open it, double-click on **index.html** and you're good to go!

## How to use 

You can only operate with the keyboard arrows. Very simple and minimalistic! :)

## What is the point?

Your goal is to reach the water at the other end of the map, then game resets. You can do it as long as you want because it's an infinite game.
